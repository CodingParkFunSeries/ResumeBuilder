-> Apart from all the basic features like forms, various resume templates and many more stuffs. 
   I think that it would be great to have a feature where the user can rate a particular template 
   so that based on the ratings of the template we could filter out what's hot in the market so 
   that it would be convinient for the user to select the top rated/popular template easily.

-> We could also implement a feature in which the user can be provided with different synonyms of
   words so that "Abstract/About/Short Introduction/Bio" section would look better. This feature
   would be very helpful to users frame their "Abstract" in a better way.
